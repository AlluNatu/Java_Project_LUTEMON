## Description
This is a project made for my CT60A2411 Olio-ohjelmointi course (Object-oriented programming). From this project we got graded 30/30.
The project is meant to be a game for android devices. The game is not that complicated and reminds of Pokemon Go type game. It is a turn based battle game where you battle your Lutemon (object) against other Lutemon.

## Implemented features:
- Lutemons (Name, Color (Each color has its own image)) (Different starting stats for different colors)
- List Lutemons (RecycleView)
- Train Lutemons (Can increase attack or defense) (Click counter, for example, 20 presses add +2 to selected stats)
- Engage Lutemons in battles (Lutemons don't die but return home. Winner gains +1 experience)
- Save/Load Lutemons
- Lutemons have statistics (e.g., battles, wins/losses)
- In battles, Attacker has a sword and Defender has a shield
- Battles include a chance for a "critical attack" (Random)
